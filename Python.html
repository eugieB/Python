	<h1> FREE CODEACADEMY </h1>
	<li> <a href = " "> 
	<br>
	<br><p1 Today Class is about the website called codefreeacademy that will teach you about coding in python however i will be a problem to those that have not used it since so why have it been a slow website I will show you on the problems that the class may lack. Moving on the WIFI speed should be at a standard that allows Lenovo laptop to access the WIFI at a slow rating. So at what point do you need to know that when the manager puts the question as to when should it be, I will just have to present the job to him that it's manger by the Include Africa wifi. The reason for doing this to make it is that you have to be incharge of ccreating new content that has to be using Python to the right length, that is mature for the spokeperson. </p1>

<h1> Inplementing Python 1 </h1> 
 	if X == 0:
		else:
	then x == 0;
	print("It has been achieved ")
	<br>
	<p1> The reason thing is that you should print out something that is It has been achieved otherwise you should recieve something that is not it  </p1> 
		<br>
	<H1> Implementing Python 2 </H1> 
			<br>
	<p1> Implementing Boolean in Python 2 </p1> 
		<br>
	 IF TRUE Print(' Thank you") 
		ELSE
			PRINT ("SORRY");
	<br><br> 
	<h1> Implementing Python 3 </h1>
	<p1> The Next thing would be to creating a text story that is created from Python otherwise its loses its favourite about Object orietated langauge </p1> 
	<h2> VALUES </h2> 
	<br><br>
			Numbers = 45
			Age = 12
			ID = 287394234234
		<br> <br>
	<h2> Strings </h1>
		<br><br>
			Name = " Altron" 
			Last = " BECK" 
			Stagename = "The Pur"
<br><br>
	<p2> This is the string that you have to use in order to reasssign to the object that you want. </p2>

	<br><br> 
<h1> Implementing Python 4 </h1> <br>
			<H2> ERROR </H2>
			IF  HELLO == print(' welcome") 

				Then print{" welcome"} 
<br><br>
		<p2> The last statement is incorrect that you shouldn't use curly brackets instead it should use  the right one that is supppose to be used else  you end up using have an error in the code that must run. </p2> 
			<H2>  Adding Try statement </H2> 
		<br><br>
				COLLINS = LEAVE
				2382.034 = True 

				A = 78
				C = A 
			 	IF C == A
<h1> Implementing Python 5 </h1> 
		<h2> COMMENTS  </h2> 
				<br>
			IF Python == 57.89  #please dont be scared of the fact that you ignore 58.89

				PRINT (" PYTHON" ) #This is a print statement that will be shown on the otherside. 
			<br><br><br>
			<p2 > The code always needs to be improved are you should be able to go back to tge code thgat does not have the right attahcment to it so commenting needed </p2>
			<p2> How do you continue using the lanaguge at a point where lanague evolves and transforms into something that is excting to everyone. so most people use that lastest feature to give back to the people. </p2>
<h1> Implementing Python 6 </h1>
		<h2> Indentation </h2> 
			<p2> How should code look will be determined on the use of indentation, by using the the language that is 
				new to most people it will just need the best new thing. </p2>
<br><br>
				Button = "ENTER"

					IF:
						button == "Enter"
					ELSE:
						print ("sumitted")
<br>
<p> This is the perfect use of using indentation in the world of python. It promises the way you should be in touch with the other poeple. The mutiple of semi colons is that they have been using this for the pass  years that has not been. That is why you have to make sure there is not need to be under the wrong lanaguge that is too wrong that is not suppose that, not be correct so why  should you be so wrong yet in the moment. The path giving the user the that reason that they should always need to be incharge of what they are doing be incharge. </p> 
<br>
	<h1> Implementing Python 7 </h1>
			<h2> Python is a object orientated language.</h2> 
				<p1> So if I was able to able to bring back the object from where is was then I would use it. This is not the full use of wht it means to be able to 
					use the protential orientantion, otherwise it will be inhertitance to the user, we will work on that in the later lesson. By Assigning objects it will work better in python.</p1> 
				
						IF 
							Name === seventysix;
						ELSE: 
							seventysix. 
						OR:
							Print(Name)
		<h1> BOOLEAN Values </h1> 
			<p1> I may be that it is a language that iust used to reveal so many value that will be already incharge of visual studio. understand that it will not be the same for most people </p1> 
<br><br>
			<h2> BOOLEAN </h2>  
				 TRUE  == 1 
				 FALSE  == 0 
				 OR  == 1 or 0
<br><br>
			<h1> Implementing Python 8 </h1>
			<h1> INHERITANCE  </h1> 
		<p2> As you have learned that that python uses feature that is special to its design but you can not use elsewhere so values are but can be different </p2>
		<h1> Implementing Python 9 </h1>
		<p2> The best thing about using Python that, the best and fun thing about it, the other cool part is that you have too make sure that it is the reason that you have a platform for using it Like for instance you can use Codeblock for Python otherwise, you have to use Pycharm to be a better software developer, however inorder to not keep using Notepad. Hence for if you use it for. CodeBlock is for C++ otherwise.  </p2> 
		<h2> Feature in Pycharm </h2> 
		<li> Inputs and Outputs </li> 
		<li> Conditional Statements </li>
		<li> For Loops and While Loops </li> 
		<li> Functions </li>
		<br><br> 
<p1> the whole idea is that you become more in control of what you are doing. So that the user can unlock the full potential of what it means to be the software developer. the feature merely leave the user in owe so that you can be better with other devices that are so slow. </p1>

<br><br>
		<h2> Lets dive in </h2>
		<h1> Implementing Python 10</h1> 
		<h3> EXAMPLE </h3> 
		X = 5 
		Var  X = 5; 
		Var  X = 6;
		<br><br>
		<p2> The difference is that you have JS that it is not the same as other programs that are within the python language so why would. At what point you not be able to change  the values will detemine on how you should have a language running otherwise it is the right. </p2> 
<br><br>
 			<h1> Implementing Python 11 </h1> 
				<p2> Creating the object in the world of Python </p2>  
				<br><br>
				CONSTANT_NAME 
				TAX_RATE_PERCENTAGE = 32 
			<br><br>

			<p3> There is no difference into what it is to define a thing in Python or in another language or you should be. Otherwise, Hence forth you should be able to control the lanaguge thats there. </p3>

			<h1> Implementing Python 12 </h1> 
				<h2> Null and None. </h2> 

<br><br><br> 
<img src = " https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-144.png "/> 
<br><br> 
		<h1> Implementing Python 13 </h1> 
			<p2> List and arrays are hidden deep in the language of Python that, that is why most people that use the feature end up reaching a terminal that is pointless to those that need to know about it, when I was studying the arrays and list of differenct langauge I had little time to use time so it is perfectly understandable to be at a terminal of arrays they a merely the source of picking up to many values all at ones </p2> <p1> They are just values that are suppose to have Block brackets </p1>

<Textarea> Please edit the information that is different! </Textarea>
<h3> Editor: Mogomotsi Gumede </h3>
		<p1> I am learning python in class and this is the class that I am taking in this case I have been able to by myself. However if you get a chance alway use a book for instance there a Book based on Python called Python for dummies, or it could be a Collins related book. </p>
<br>

<br><br>
<p1> the Best thing about the fact how can you continue to do the best thing that is suppose to be just an simple touch of what it means recreate code in the light of perfect use and why you shold be the reason to being seen by other people lives so hence for using a edgy platform given from a platform. The edge behind the platform is that it is well uniformed and insist on the ultra use Pycharm. </p1>
